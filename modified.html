In HTML documents, tags define the start and end of headings, paragraphs, lists, character highlighting and links. Most HTML elements are identified in a document as a start tag, which gives the element name and attributes, followed by the content, followed by the end tag. Start tags are delimited by < and >, and end tags are delimited by </ and >. For example:

   
Some elements appear as just a start tag. For example, to create a line break, you use .
The content of an element is a sequence of characters and nested elements. Some elements, such as anchors, cannot be nested. Anchors and character highlighting may be put inside other constructs. The content model for a tag defines the syntax permitted for the content.

       In HTML documents, tags define the start and end of headings, paragraphs, lists, character highlighting and links. Most HTML elements are identified in a document as a start tag, which gives the element name and attributes, followed by the content, followed by the end tag. Start tags are delimited by < and >, and end tags are delimited by . For example: Some elements appear as just a start tag. For example, to create a line break, you use . The content of an element is a sequence of characters and nested elements. Some elements, such as anchors, cannot be nested. Anchors and character highlighting may be put inside other constructs. The content model for a tag defines the syntax permitted for the content.

       This image symbolises the spark of innovation.Innovation in its modern meaning is "a new idea, creative thoughts, new imaginations in form of device or method".Innovation is often also viewed as the application of better solutions that meet new requirements, unarticulated needs, or existing market needs.Such innovation takes place through the provision of more-effective products, processes, services, technologies, or business models that are made available to markets, governments and society. An innovation is something original and more effective and, as a consequence, new, that "breaks into" the market or society.Innovation is related to, but not the same as, invention, as innovation is more apt to involve the practical implementation of an invention (ie new / improved ability) to make a meaningful impact in the market or society, and not all innovations require an invention. Innovation often[quantify] manifests itself via the engineering process, when the problem being solved is of a technical or scientific nature. The opposite of innovation is exnovation. While a novel device is often described as an innovation, in economics, management science, and other fields of practice and analysis, innovation is generally considered to be the result of a process that brings together various novel ideas in such a way that they affect society. In industrial economics, innovations are created and found empirically from services to meet growing consumer demand.
<br/><br/>
       Innovation also has an older historical meaning which is quite different. From the 1400s through the 1600s, prior to early American settlement, the concept of "innovation" was pejorative. It was an early modern synonym for rebellion, revolt and heresy. <br/> src-Wikipedia<br/>    </p>
